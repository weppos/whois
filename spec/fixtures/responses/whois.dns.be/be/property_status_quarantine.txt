%- The WHOIS service offered by DNS.be and the access to the records in the
%- DNS.be WHOIS database are provided for information purposes only. It allows
%- persons to check whether a specific domain name is still available or not
%- and to obtain information related to the registration records of
%- existing domain names.
%-
%- DNS.be cannot, under any circumstances, be held liable where the stored
%- information would prove to be incomplete or inaccurate in any sense.

%- By submitting a query you agree not to use the information made available
%- to:
%-   - allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited,
%-     commercial advertising or other solicitations whether via email or otherwise;
%-   - target advertising in any possible way;
%-   - to cause nuisance in any possible way to the domain name holders by sending 
%-     messages to them (whether by automated, electronic processes capable of
%-     enabling high volumes or other possible means).
%- 
%- Without prejudice to the above, it is explicitly forbidden to extract, copy
%- and/or use or re-utilise in any form and by any means (electronically or
%- not) the whole or a quantitatively or qualitatively substantial part
%- of the contents of the WHOIS database without prior and explicit permission
%- by DNS.be, nor in any attempt thereof, to apply automated, electronic
%- processes to DNS.be (or its systems).
%-
%- You agree that any reproduction and/or transmission of data for commercial
%- purposes will always be considered as the extraction of a substantial
%- part of the content of the WHOIS database.
%-
%- By submitting the query you agree to abide by this policy and accept that
%- DNS.be can take measures to limit the use of its whois services in order to
%- protect the privacy of its registrants or the integrity of the database.
