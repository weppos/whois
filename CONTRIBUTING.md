# Contributing

## Workflow

Fork, then clone the repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:your-username/whois.git
```

Set up your machine:

```shell
bundle
```

Make sure the tests pass:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

To propose a change/feature/patch, create your feature branch:

```shell
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

Commit your changes:

```shell
git commit -am 'Add some feature'
```

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/weppos/whois/compare/).


## Tests

To increase the chance that your pull request is accepted please **make sure to write tests**. Changes without corresponding tests will likely not be included as they will produce fragile code that can easily break whenever the registry changes the response format.
